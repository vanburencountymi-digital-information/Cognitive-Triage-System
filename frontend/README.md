#### üé® Center - Graph Canvas
The main workflow builder with interactive nodes and edges:

**Node Management**
- **Add Nodes**: Click "Add Node" to place agents in your workflow (no persona selection required)
- **Blank Nodes**: Create nodes without personas - they appear with a yellow border and "No persona selected" text
- **Assign Personas**: Click any node to open context menu and select a persona from the dropdown
- **Drag Nodes**: Move nodes around the canvas to organize your workflow
- **Select Nodes**: Click any node to see its context menu
- **Delete Nodes**: Use context menu or keyboard shortcuts

**Edge Management**
- **Create Connections**: Drag from one node's bottom handle to another's top handle
- **Select Edges**: Click any edge to see its context menu
- **Edit Connections**: Use dropdowns in edge context menu to change source/target
- **Delete Edges**: Use context menu, keyboard shortcuts, or control panel

**Control Panel (Top-Left)**
- **Add Node**: Add new agent nodes to the workflow (creates blank nodes if no persona selected)
- **Delete Node**: Remove selected node
- **Delete Edge**: Remove selected edge
- **Clear Agent Nodes**: Remove all agent nodes (keeps special nodes)

#### üìä Right Sidebar - Results
- **Results Display**: Shows workflow execution results and intermediate outputs
- **Execution Status**: Real-time feedback on workflow progress

## üéÆ Interactive Context Menus

### Node Context Menu
When you click on a node, a context menu appears next to it with:

**For Custom Nodes (Agent Nodes):**
- **Node Information**: Displays the current persona name and role
- **Node Status**: Shows whether the node is "Assigned" or "Unassigned"
- **Persona Dropdown**: Change the persona assigned to this node (or assign one to blank nodes)
- **Delete Button**: Remove the node from the workflow

**For Special Nodes:**
- **Node Type**: Shows the special node type (e.g., "prompt")
- **Description**: Displays the node's description
- **Info Message**: Indicates that special nodes cannot be deleted

### Edge Context Menu
When you click on an edge, a context menu appears with:

- **Source Node Dropdown**: Change the source node of the connection
- **Target Node Dropdown**: Change the target node of the connection
- **Delete Button**: Remove the edge from the workflow

### Context Menu Features
- **Dynamic Positioning**: Menu appears next to the clicked item
- **Auto-Close**: Click anywhere else to close the menu
- **Keyboard Support**: Press `Escape` to close
- **Smooth Animations**: Fade-in effect when menu appears
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes

## üîß System Management

The System Manager (accessible via the Systems tab) allows you to save and load complete workflow configurations:

### Saving Systems
1. Build your workflow using the graph canvas
2. Switch to the Systems tab in the left sidebar
3. Enter a name and optional description
4. Click "Save System"

### Loading Systems
1. Open the Systems tab
2. Select a system from the dropdown
3. Click "Load" to restore the workflow
4. Use "Delete" to remove unwanted systems

### Example Systems
The backend includes pre-built example systems:
- **Basic Customer Service**: Simple 2-agent workflow
- **Full Quality Assurance**: Complete 4-agent workflow
- **Direct Response**: Single agent for quick responses

To load examples, run the backend script: `python backend/load_examples.py`

## üéØ Getting Started

1. **Start the backend server**: `python backend/app.py`
2. **Start the frontend**: `npm start`
3. **Open your browser**: Navigate to http://localhost:3000

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Building a Workflow
1. **Add Nodes**: Click "Add Node" to place agents in your workflow (creates blank nodes if no persona selected)
2. **Assign Personas**: Click nodes to open context menu and select personas from the dropdown
3. **Connect Nodes**: Drag from one node's bottom handle to another's top handle
4. **Edit Connections**: Click edges to modify source/target nodes via dropdowns
5. **Configure Nodes**: Click nodes to change personas via dropdown
6. **Save Workflow**: Use the Systems tab to save your configuration

### Running a Workflow
1. **Enter Prompt**: Type your question or request in the prompt field
2. **Validate Workflow**: The system will check that all nodes have personas assigned
3. **Run Workflow**: Click "Run Crew Workflow" to execute your AI agents
4. **View Results**: See the final output and individual step results on the right

### Managing Elements
- **Select Items**: Click any node or edge to select it
- **Delete Items**: Use context menu delete buttons or press `Delete` key
- **Edit Properties**: Use context menu dropdowns to modify settings
- **Close Menus**: Click elsewhere or press `Escape`

### Blank Nodes and Validation

The system supports creating nodes without personas assigned, providing flexibility in workflow design:

**Creating Blank Nodes**
- Click "Add Node" without selecting a persona first
- Blank nodes appear with a yellow border and "No persona selected" text
- They are visually distinct from assigned nodes for easy identification

**Assigning Personas to Blank Nodes**
- Click any blank node to open its context menu
- Use the persona dropdown to select an appropriate persona
- The node will immediately update to show the assigned persona

**Workflow Validation**
- Before running a workflow, the system validates that all nodes have personas assigned
- If any blank nodes are found, execution is blocked with a clear error message
- The error message lists the specific nodes that need personas assigned
- This prevents incomplete workflows from being executed

**Visual Indicators**
- **Assigned Nodes**: Blue border with persona name displayed
- **Blank Nodes**: Yellow border with "No persona selected" in italic text
- **Context Menu Status**: Shows "Assigned" or "Unassigned" status
